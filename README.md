** Pokemon Project **

This project is a simple react app that get a list of pokemons names from the pokemon api ("https://pokeapi.co/").

In this app i used react hooks like useState, useEffect and useRef to fetch the data, pass it to the PokemonList component and display the list.

I've added a paggination to display only 20 names in a single request: the user can choose to go to the next page or to go back to the previeus page..
